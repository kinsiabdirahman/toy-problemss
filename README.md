## Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)

### Description

Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond to the correct grade, as shown below:

- A > 79
- B - 60 to 79
- C - 59 to 49
- D - 40 to 49
- E - less than 40

### File

- detector.js

## Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

### Description

Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input (e.g., 80). If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

- For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

### File

- grader.js
